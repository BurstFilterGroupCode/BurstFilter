### Folder Structure

src/sketch: Contains the code for the sketch algorithm.

src/util: Holds code for dataset reading, hash templates, and other utilities.

### Files

src/sketch/newsketch/param.cpp(.h): Basic parameters for the algorithm, detailed comments inside the file.

runtest/runtest.cpp: Executes experiments in bulk using command-line commands.

src/util/read_dataset.cpp(.h): Reads datasets, with the option to specify specific datasets in the file.

src/chk_cache.cpp: Calculates cache efficiency using cache logs generated by run_newsketch.

src/chk_l*u.cpp: Tests LRU/LFU cache efficiency.

run_correct.cpp: Executes the unordered_map algorithm, generates correct burst lists, and outputs them to tmp/correct.txt.

read_correct.cpp(.h): Facilitates reading correct burst lists for other algorithms.

run_newsketch.cpp: Runs the new sketch algorithm, outputs cache logs, compares obtained bursts with tmp/correct.txt, and calculates accuracy.

run_strawman.cpp: Executes the comparative algorithm.

run_***.cpp: Runs other comparative algorithms, compares obtained bursts with tmp/correct.txt, and calculates accuracy.

run_temp.cpp: Executes temperature test algorithms, with the algorithm implemented in this CPP file.

run_timewidth_test.cpp: Executes time span detection algorithms between packets.

run_jitter_test.cpp: Executes jitter detection algorithms, with the algorithm implemented in this CPP file.

Command-line instructions and parameters are documented within the files.
